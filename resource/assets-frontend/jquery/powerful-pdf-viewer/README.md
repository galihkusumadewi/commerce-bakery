# jquery.pdfviewer
A simple pdf viewer based on the powerfull and unfortunately less documented Mozilla PdfJs library. It offers basic features such as go to the previous page, go the first page, go the next page, go to the last page, zoom-in, zoom-out, zoom-to, go to page.
# Dependencies
- JQuery 3.7.0+
- Crably PrintJs (optional)
  It's recommended to use printjs (https://printjs.crabbly.com/) for printing. If Crably is not present, the default printing engine opens
 an annoying new window before printing.
